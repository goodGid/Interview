```
if you are calling save in a loop that 
means a new transaction is being created each time you call save,

but in the case of saveAll 
there is one call and 
therefor one transaction created regardless of the number of entities being saved.

[Performance Difference Between save() and saveAll() in Spring Data](https://www.baeldung.com/spring-data-save-saveall)

```
each time we call the save() method, 
a new transaction is created

whereas when we call saveAll(),
only one transaction is created, 
and it's reused later by save().
